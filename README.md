# FlyDirect: Decentralized Healthcare Communication Platform

## Overview
FlyDirect is an innovative, open-source platform designed to revolutionize communication within the healthcare ecosystem. By utilizing decentralized identities (DIDs) and adhering to Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards, FlyDirect enables secure, private, and standardized communication among patients, healthcare practitioners, insurers, and related entities. This project is under the MIT license, promoting a collaborative development environment.

## Features

- FHIR Standard Adherence: Ensures efficient, error-free data exchange and interoperability across various healthcare systems.
- Threshold Cryptography: Offers robust security for sensitive health information through the Lit protocol, safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality.
- IPFS Integration: Provides decentralized data storage, preventing data loss, enhancing availability, and ensuring scalability.
- Real-Time Communication: Facilitates instant, reliable notifications and communications among users via the Push Protocol.
- Comprehensive Stakeholder Engagement: Encourages a holistic healthcare communication environment for informed and efficient decision-making.
- Open-Source Collaboration: Allows developers worldwide to contribute, adapt, and customize, driving the platform's evolution.
